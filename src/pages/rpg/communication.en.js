        Now that we've laid out the basics, let's apply ourselves and have some fun üòä Before you
        build your <RPG /> we first must learn how to get input and send messages to the player.
        There's no use in coding an adventure if there's no way to interact with it.
      </p>
      <div className="comments">
        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>
          Comments allow us to write things in our code that is purely for notation (like writing
          notes in your math). Anything in the same line that comes after "//" will not be used
          while your code is running.
          <br />
          <br />
          We can use comments for things like add a TODO message so you can come back to add
          something later, or we can use it to help explain how our code works.

        <h2>Input/Output for Communicating with the Player</h2>
        <p>
          While modifying the content of a webpage (done via HTML) is outside of the <Scope /> of
          this project, we can still communicate with the player from inside JavaScript! We can do
          this using the prompt and alert functions. From now on if you wish to run the code in the
          editors{' '}
          <span className="bold">
            you must press the <span className={play}>‚ñ∂</span> button
          </span>{' '}
          first. Try running the examples below:
        </p>
        <h3>Output: Alert</h3>
        <CodeSandbox
          value="alert('Your princess is in another castle')"
          consoleMode
          disableAutoRun
          className="mini"
        />
        <h3>Input: Prompt</h3>
        <p>
          We can ask a user for input and save it to a <Variable /> to use it later
        </p>
        <CodeSandbox
          value={
            "var user = prompt('What is your name?')\nalert('Wishing ' + user + ' good fortune üí∞')"
          }
          consoleMode
          disableAutoRun
          className="mini"
        />
        <p>
          Note: In normal web development the use of the alert and prompt functions is discouraged.
          This is because creating dialogue inside of the page (using HTML) rather than inside of
          the browsers pop-up boxes is less jarring.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="flow-control">
        <h2>Flow Control</h2>
        <p>
          Flow control allows us to establish branching choices in our logic model using{' '}
          <BooleanDef /> logic. You might say something along the lines of "if x is true then do y,
          or else do z". It allows us to create flexible code that chooses the appropriate path to
          take in order to properly complete the task. You can read more about flow control{' '}
          <a target="_blank" href="https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/ch_control-flow.html">
            here.
          </a>
        </p>
        <h3>if/else</h3>
        <p>
          You can use combinations of if and else to make powerful decision making models using{' '}
          <Expression>expressions</Expression> that return <BooleanDef>booleans</BooleanDef> to ask
          yes or no questions. Here we have an example of doing something based on the user's input
        </p>
        <CodeSandbox
          value={
            '// Notice that any spaces or uppercases will cause the equality to fail, so "YES" will give the wrong result\nif(prompt("Do you like oatmeal raisin cookies?") === "yes") { \n    alert("You have good taste in üç™")\n} else { // They entered anything besides exactly "yes"\n    alert("Maybe üç™ just aren\'t your thing?")\n}'
          }
          consoleMode
          disableAutoRun
          className="short"
        />
        <p>We can also chain multiple ifs together to have multiple outcomes</p>

        <CodeSandbox
          value={
            'var favoriteCookie = prompt("What\'s your favorite kind of cookie?")\nif(favoriteCookie === "oatmeal" || favoriteCookie === "oatmeal raisin") { \n    alert("You have good taste in üç™")\n} else if (favoriteCookie === "chocolate chip") {\n    alert("Chocolate chip is the second best cookie so that\'s understandable")\n} else {\n    alert("Maybe üç™ just aren\'t your thing?")\n}'
          }
          consoleMode
          disableAutoRun
          className="short"
        />
        <h3>while</h3>
        <p>
          You can use the while loop to keep doing something until the <BooleanDef /> <Expression />{' '}
          returns false. Look here how we can repeatedly ask the user for their name until they
          return a valid name (if a name is missing it is invalid, if the user exits the prompt the
          prompt it returns null so we must retry).
        </p>
        <CodeSandbox
          disableAutoRun
          consoleMode
          value={
            'var name\nwhile(!name) {\n    name = prompt("What is your name adventurer?")\n}\nalert("You wake up on a strange beach. \'" + name + "\' is written on the inside of your shirt.")'
          }
          className="short"

      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Better text Handling</h2>
        <p>
          I've created this function to help you ensure you receive valid input. Strings provide
          .trim(...) function to remove all spaces from the beginning and end. Here we check that
          the trimmed string is at least 1 character long (meaning that there's at least 1 non-space
          character). Then we return the trimmed string as we probably don't care about the spaces
          and it can make it harder to match strings later (for example "yes " === "yes" will return
          false, but if we trim the text we don't have this problem)
        </p>
        <CodeSandbox
          disableAutoRun
          consoleMode
          value={`function smartPrompt(question) {
    var output = null
    // While will keep running the code inside it over and over until the expression evaluates to false
    while(output === null || output.trim().length < 1) { 
        output = prompt(question)
    }
    return output.trim()
}

var name = smartPrompt("What is your name adventurer?")

alert("You wake up on a strange beach. '" + name + "' is written on the inside of your shirt.")`}
        />
        <p>
          Here we combine the .toLowerCase <FunctionDef /> (you can use it to make any <StringDef />{' '}
          lowercase) and our smartPrompt <FunctionDef />. Notice how when we run it it still
          recognizes a yes input even if it has whitespace around it or isn't lowercase.
        </p>
        <CodeSandbox
          value={`function smartPrompt(question) {
    var output = null
    while(output === null || output.trim().length < 1) {
        output = prompt(question)
    }
    return output.trim()
}
// Now it accepts "  yes  ", "YES", "  yEs   ", etc
if(smartPrompt("Do you like oatmeal raisin cookies?").toLowerCase() === "yes") { \n    alert("You have good taste in üç™")\n} else {\n    alert("Maybe üç™ just aren\'t your thing?")\n}`}
