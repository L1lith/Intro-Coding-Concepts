      <h2>What will you learn?</h2>
      <p>
        In this course I will explain the basics of coding in JavaScript. You will make your own
        text based <RPG /> game that you can share with your friends 😃 I hope that I can make
        learning to code simple for you.

      <h2>Why this course?</h2>
      <p>
        I designed this course to be easy to understand, and to be easy to get started. You don't
        need to install anything, and it works on mobile and cheaper computer devices. I also have
        used games and videos to make it a more engaging and interactive experience.
