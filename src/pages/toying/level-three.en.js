        How does <BooleanDef /> logic tie into coding? When a programmer is coding they write in a
        special language called a <Syntax />. Every coding language can have different{' '}
        <Syntax>syntaxes</Syntax>, but ultimately they are just different ways of representing our
        logic models using code.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rather than writing enormous combinations of ORs, NOTs, and other logical{' '}
        <Operator>operators</Operator>, software engineers conveniently created coding languages
        packed in with features that allow us to say what we are trying to do more easily. In fact,
        nearly every coding language has support for <BooleanDef /> logic built-in, which is an
        essential part of your toolkit as a coder.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've prepared one final challenge in case you'd like to test your skills at the matching
        game one more time before we proceed to talk about coding.

        You might have noticed that when given a NOT <Operator /> with multiple values, it is
        sometimes easier to think of it as simply a request for whatever is missing. This is an
        example of how we can build more complex rules from simplistic systems. Writing good
        software is about learning to create apps with complex capabilities without making the code
        itself overly complex or messy.
        <br />
        <br />
        Like speaking any language (human or machine), learning how to better express yourself (by
        using clean code and good design practices) allows you to say more while writing less.
        Spending more time to think about your code from a design perspective will allow you to save
        countless hours dealing with mind-numbing bugs and other issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many coding languages have the capabilities to compare and transform other kinds of data
        more advanced than <BooleanDef>booleans</BooleanDef>, which is very powerful. We can do
        things like evaluate math <Expression>expressions</Expression>, compare text, and more.
        Watch this video to see this in practice, and to see the relationship between the{' '}
        <BooleanDef /> logic and coding mental models.
