      <p>
        In this section we will be playing the Matching Rules game in order to learn about{' '}
        <BooleanDef /> logic. <BooleanDef>Boolean</BooleanDef> logic is the fundamental language
        that both electronic circuitry, and computers themselves are made out of, and it happens to
        be a great tool for learning how we talk to computers.
        <br />
        <br />
        <BooleanDef>Boolean</BooleanDef> logic contains a set of{' '}
        <Expression>expressions</Expression> (kind of like coding language) that allow us to perform
        basic <Operator>operations</Operator> on data. True or false statements (boolean values like
        yes or no) are the main type of <Expression>expressions</Expression> handled with{' '}
        <BooleanDef /> logic. This means we can ask the computer yes or no questions using code to
        tell it what to do.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>The "Or" Operator</h2>
      <p>
        Or is a logical <Operator /> that will only output true if at least one of it's inputs are
        true. In the first level of the Matching Game we will experiment with the Or <Operator />.
        Choose only the tiles whose colors and shapes are allowed to win.
