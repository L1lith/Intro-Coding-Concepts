      This course focuses on being palatable for beginners, so if you'd like to learn about
      JavaScript in more depth, or you have questions I recommend the following resources:

              Daniel Schiffman teaches all kinds of things including web development, 2D game
              development, and more. I'd highly recommend him if you're looking for an engaging way
              to learn more about coding.

              StackOverflow is a little like the yahoo answers of the coding world (but please don't
              spam silly questions). If you have an issue chances are someones had the exact same
              one before. If you're stuck and can't figure something out search on there,{' '}
              <span className="bold">google it</span>, and if you still can't find the answer feel
              free to open a new question.
