We can do this using\n        the prompt and alert functions. I've disabled auto-running so it won't spam you with\n        prompts, but from now on you must manually run the code.

You might say something along the lines of \"if x is true then do y, or else do z\". It\n        allows us to create flexible code that chooses the appropriate path to take in order to\n        properly complete the task.
