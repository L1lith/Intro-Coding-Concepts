I\'m glad you asked! When we are coding we too are writing a logic system to handle the input flow of information (like mouse and keyboard input when navigating a webpage) and the output flow of information (like displaying a webpage or rendering a video-game). As a coder you write (or "code") the logical rules of the system (like when the user clicks this link, take them to that page).
