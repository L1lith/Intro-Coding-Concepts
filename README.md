Learn how to code easily! Contributors welcome :)

## Why this course?

I designed this course to be easy to understand, and to be easy to get started. You don't need to install anything, and it works on mobile and cheaper computer devices. I also have used games and videos to make it a more engaging and interactive experience.

## Why I made this site

I want to make learning coding practical for beginners. I want more people to feel empowered in the era of technology. I hope that you enjoy my course.
