      üß† Mental Modeling for Beginners
    </h1>
    <p>
      In this course I will describe mental models to show how & why we apply them to coding and
      other tasks. I will also teach you JavaScript, and show you how to make your own text based
      RPG and share it with your friends :)

      <h2>Resources</h2>
      This course focuses on being palatable for beginners, so if you'd like to learn about
      JavaScript in more depth, or you have questions I recommend the following resources:
      <ul className="resource-list">
        <li>
          Daniel Shiffman makes hilarious & creative YouTube videos on his channel{' '}
          <a className="bold" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain/featured">
            The Coding Train
          </a>
          . He teaches all kinds of things including web development, 2D game development, and more.
          I'd highly recommend him if you're looking for an engaging way to learn more about coding.

          </a>{' '}
          is a little like the yahoo answers of the programming world (but please don't spam silly
          questions). If you have an issue chances are someones had the exact same one before. If
          you're stuck and can't figure something out search on there, google it, and if you still
          can't find the answer feel free to open a new question.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://javascript.info">JavaScript.info</a> is a great resource JS concepts in
          greater detail.

          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">MDN</a> is the most
          extensive site for learning about web technologies. It is maintained by the Mozilla
          foundation, but it can be overly technical or lacking information in certain areas.

          If you get stuck and something reeeally doesn't make sense, you can ask for help{' '}

          considerate and don't spam the issue section, and check first if someone's asked that
          question before or if it's already covered in the docs.
