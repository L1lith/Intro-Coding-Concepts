      Programmers are great at writing code only they can understand. Many beginners can feel
      alienated after hearing "just read the <Docs />
      ", and aren't given a proper chance to understand why coders do what they do.
      <br />
      <br />
      Documentation sites like{' '}
      <a target="_blank" href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v15.x/api/">
        this one
      </a>{' '}
      can be a valuable tool for experienced programmers, but for a beginner it's a total headache.
      It's important to understand the concepts in simple terms so you can begin to visualize what
      you are trying to do.

      Another key to learning is to practice. In this section I will guide you through basic coding
      concepts like problem solving, logic rules, and working with data. In the next chapter we will
      cement these concepts with hands-on activities.
