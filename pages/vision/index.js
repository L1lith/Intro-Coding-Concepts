      Take coding at your own pace and take time for yourself

      If you believe what you hear on the internet, you might be inclined to believe the modern
      programmer might be more easily replaced by a gang of monkeys randomly hammering away on
      type-writers, and sometimes you might be right. Many beginners meet their demise after hearing
      "just read the docs" (docs is short for documentation), and aren't given a proper chance to
      understand why coders do what they do.
      <br />
      <br />
      Documentation sites like{' '}

        <a>this one</a>
      </Link>{' '}
      can be a valuable glossary to experienced programmers, but as a learning tool it's the
      equivalent of throwing a thesaurus at your students' foreheads. This can often leave the
      reader confused & frustrated, as it fails to explain fundamental programming concepts and why
      we use them.
      <br />
      <br />
      Another barrier to learning is the lack of approachable hands-on work. In this section I will
      guide you through fundamental coding concepts (like problem solving, logic rules, and working
      with data).
