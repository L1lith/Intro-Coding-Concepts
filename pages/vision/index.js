      If you believe what you hear on the internet, you might be inclined to
      believe the modern programmer might be more easily replaced by a gang of
      monkeys randomly hammering away on type-writers, and sometimes you might
      be right. Many beginners meet their demise after hearing "just read the
      docs" (docs is short for documentation), and aren't given a proper chance
      to understand why coders do what they do.
      <br />
      <br />
      Documentation sites like{" "}
      <Link href="https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v15.x/api/">
        <a>this one</a>
      </Link>{" "}
      can be a valuable glossary to experienced programmers, but as a learning
      tool it's the equivalent of throwing a thesaurus at your students'
      foreheads. This can often leave the reader confused & frustrated, as it
      fails to explain fundamental programming concepts and why we use them.
      <br />
      <br />
      Another barrier to learning is the lack of approachable hands-on work. In
      this section I will guide you through fundamental coding concepts (like
      problem solving, logic rules, and working with data).
