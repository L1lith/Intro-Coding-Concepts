yFRPG.planning.introPartOne = Programmers are great at writing code only they can understand. Many beginners can feel alienated after hearing "just read the

yFRPG.planning.introPartThree = Documentation sites like

yFRPG.planning.introPartFour = \ can be a valuable tool for experienced programmers, but for a beginner it's a total headache. It's important to understand the concepts in simple terms so you can begin to visualize what you are trying to do.
yFRPG.planning.introPartFive = Another key to learning is to practice. In this section I will guide you through basic coding concepts like problem solving, logic rules, and working with data. In the next chapter we will cement these concepts with hands-on activities.
