      Coding doesn't have to be frustrating, let's try to have some fun with it.
      In this section I hope it will become clear how you can take an approached
      based on logic models to write basic code. I'm going to be providing many
      examples, and if you get stuck it's okay to continue on and come back
      later. Try to get a feel for what is going on overall by toying with the
      code.
