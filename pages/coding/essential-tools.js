      How do you swallow a coding lesson? One byte at a time

    <p>
      You probably have a lot of information in your head from the last section, try to do your best
      to connect that information with the upcoming tasks. In this section we will be learning some
      tools üî® to help us build logic models in JavaScript more effectively. Once you finish this
      section you will know basic coding! If you feel overwhelmed consider taking a break.
      <br />
      <br />
      We will also be using something called "console output" in our editors, so you'll be seeing
      some things that say "console.log(...)", and our program output will be whatever is inside the
      parenthesis.

      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <p>
        We can create variables in order to store (save) data values for later use. In a basic logic
        model where we only have inputs and outputs it becomes incredibly difficult to deal with
        data that persists (needs to be stored). Let's say you're writing a checking account app,
        but you're not allowed to save any data. The user might see a notification saying "You just
        spent $10.52", and yet every time they open the app they're greeted with this (try using the
        app)
      </p>

      <ShittyChecking />

      <p>
        Sounds... wonderful. Instead of doing this we store variables in our memory (or in this case
        the computer's memory) by names, and then retrieve or modify them later.
        <br />
        <br />
        Here we name a variable called balance (note we do not give it any value yet so it defaults
        to undefined)
      </p>
      <CodeSandbox className="mini" value={'var balance\nconsole.log(balance)'} consoleMode />
      <p>
        We can set a value using the assignment operator "=" and providing a value after it, and
        once we have done this we can see our variable has a value now :)
      </p>
      <CodeSandbox
        className="mini"
        value={'var balance = 14.24\nconsole.log(balance)'}
        consoleMode
      />
    </div>
    <div className="functions">
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Functions let you section off individual logic models that serve as a utility. Functions
        have a name, a set of inputs, a code section, and an output. You can re-use your function
        multiple times with different inputs. Functions use parenthesis to create their inputs, and
        later after they've been created we use parenthesis again to call it (calling a function
        means to run it). The "console.log" part of our code is an example of a function (in this
        case to output some data). It's called with parenthesis and is provided with the input of
        what we want to output (which in the previous example was the balance variable's current
        value).
      </p>
      <h2>Addition Function</h2>
      <p>
        While this function is mostly redundant, you could easily make a function to add two numbers
        together.
      </p>
      <CodeSandbox
        consoleMode
        value={'function add(a, b){\n    return a + b\n}'}
        className="short"
      />
      <p>The output is empty because we didn't log anything to the console.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="console">
      <h2>More about the Console</h2>
      On the previous page I was using the "JavaScript Expression Evaluator". On the right you would
      see what output of the JS interpreter evaluating the code on the left side. Normally when
      we're programming we are running our code from a terminal, and we see the output of the
      console.log function in real-time instead of seeing the output of the JS evaluation. We only
      need to output things to console.log when we as the developer (or coder) want to know what
      their values are.
    </div>
    <CodeSandbox
      consoleMode
      value={'function add(a, b){\n    return a + b\n}\nconsole.log(add(14, 16))'}
      className="short"
    />
    <div className="parenthesis">
      <h2>Parenthesis</h2>
      Not only can you use parenthesis to change the ordering of math expressions, but you can also
      use parenthesis to change the ordering of any other kind of expression. Here are some example
      of changing the order of code evaluation using parenthesis for math and non-math purposes.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Math Without Parenthesis</h3>
      <CodeSandbox consoleMode value="console.log(10 * 3 + 4)" className="mini" />
      <h3>Math With Parenthesis</h3>
      <CodeSandbox consoleMode value="console.log(10 * (3 + 4))" className="mini" />
      <h3>Boolean logic without Parenthesis</h3>
      <CodeSandbox consoleMode value="console.log(false && true || true)" className="mini" />
      <h3>Boolean logic with Parenthesis</h3>
      <CodeSandbox consoleMode value="console.log(false && (true || true))" className="mini" />
