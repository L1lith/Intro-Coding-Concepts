    <p>
      You probably have a lot of information in your head from the last section, try to do your best
      to connect that information with the upcoming tasks. In this section we will be learning some
      tools ðŸ”¨ to help us build logic models in JavaScript more effectively. Once you finish this
      section you will know basic coding! If you feel overwhelmed consider taking a break.
      <br />
      <br />
      We will also be using terminal mode instead of the <Expression /> evaluator mode in our
      editors, so you'll be seeing some things that say "console.log(...)", and our program output
      will be whatever is inside the parenthesis (this is called a <FunctionDef />, there is more on
      this below).
    </p>
    <div>
      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <p>
        We can create <Variable>variables</Variable> in order to store (save) data values for later
        use. In a basic logic model where we only have <Input>inputs</Input> and{' '}
        <Output>outputs</Output>, so it becomes incredibly difficult to deal with data that persists
        (needs to be saved). Let's say you're writing a checking account app, but you're not allowed
        to save any data. The user might see a notification saying "You just spent $10.52", and yet
        every time they open the app they're greeted with this{' '}
        <span className="bold">(try using the app below)</span>
      </p>

      <ShittyChecking />

      <p>
        This would be so annoying! Instead of doing this we store <Variable>variables</Variable> in
        our memory (or in this case the computer's memory) by giving them names, and then we can
        retrieve or modify them later when we need them.
        <br />
        <br />
        Here we name a <Variable /> called balance (note we do not give it any value yet so it
        defaults to undefined)
      </p>
      <CodeSandbox className="mini" value={'var balance\nconsole.log(balance)'} consoleMode />
      <p>
        We can set a value by using the assignment operator "=" and putting the value we want after
        it, and once we have done this we can see our <Variable /> has a value now :)
      </p>
      <CodeSandbox
        className="mini"
        value={'var balance = 14.24\nconsole.log(balance)'}
        consoleMode
      />
    </div>
    <div className="functions">
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
        <FunctionDef>Functions</FunctionDef> let you make re-usable pieces of code that serve as a
        tool (like a blueprint of how to do something). <FunctionDef>Functions</FunctionDef> have a
        name, a set of <Input>inputs</Input>, a code section, and an <Output>output</Output> (we use
        "return" to specify the output). <FunctionDef>Functions</FunctionDef> can save you a lot of
        time because you can re-use your function multiple times with different inputs, rather than
        having to write that piece of code over and over. <FunctionDef>Functions</FunctionDef> use
        parenthesis to create their inputs, and brackets (they look like this {'{}'}). After we've
        created our <FunctionDef /> we use parenthesis again to call it (calling a <FunctionDef />{' '}
        means to run it) The "console.log" part of our code is an example of a function (in this
        case to <Output /> some data). This <FunctionDef /> doesn't have to be created by us because
        it's given to us automatically by the <Interpreter>JS interpreter</Interpreter>. It's called
        (to call a <FunctionDef /> means to run it) with parenthesis and it can do different things
        depending on what the <Input /> we put inside it is (which in the previous example was the
        balance <Variable>variable's</Variable> current value).
      </p>
      <h2>Addition Function</h2>
      <p>
        While this <FunctionDef /> is mostly redundant, you could easily make a <FunctionDef /> to
        add two numbers together.
      </p>
      <CodeSandbox
        consoleMode
        value={'function add(a, b){\n    return a + b\n}'}
        className="short"
      />
      <p>
        The <Output /> is empty because we didn't log anything to the console.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className="console">
      <h2>More about the Console</h2>
      On the previous page I was using the "JavaScript Expression Evaluator". On the right you would
      see what <Output /> of the <Interpreter>JS interpreter</Interpreter> evaluating the code on
      the left side. Normally when we're coding we are running our code from a terminal, and we see
      the <Output /> of the console.log <FunctionDef /> in real-time instead of seeing the{' '}
      <Output /> of the JS evaluation. We only need to <Output /> values using console.log when we
      as the developer (or coder) want to know what those values are, that way our program's{' '}
      <Output /> doesn't get super cluttered.
    </div>
    <CodeSandbox
      consoleMode
      value={'function add(a, b){\n    return a + b\n}\nconsole.log(add(14, 16))'}
      className="short"
    />
    <div className="parenthesis">
      <h2>Parenthesis</h2>
      Not only can you use parenthesis to change the ordering of math{' '}
      <Expression>expressions</Expression>, but you can also use parenthesis to change the ordering
      of any other kind of <Expression />. Here are some example of changing the order of code
      evaluation using parenthesis for math and non-math purposes.
